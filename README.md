### Project Scope
- **Data Import and Transformation**: Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **Data Modeling and Relationships**: Structuring data tables for efficient querying.
- **KPI and Metrics Creation**: Defining and tracking business-critical metrics.
- **Interactive Report and Dashboard Design**: Building user-friendly, dynamic visuals.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes COVID-19 statistics for various countries, with a focus on Afghanistan and Albania in the provided sample.

### Sources
- **WHO COVID-19 Dataset**: Public health data likely sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO), containing global COVID-19 statistics.  

### Key Fields
- **Country/Region**: Name of the country (e.g., Afghanistan, Albania).
- **Confirmed**: Total confirmed COVID-19 cases (e.g., 36263 for Afghanistan, 4880 for Albania).
- **Deaths**: Total deaths due to COVID-19 (e.g., 1269 for Afghanistan, 144 for Albania).
- **Recovered**: Total recovered cases (e.g., 25198 for Afghanistan, 2745 for Albania).
- **Active**: Active cases (e.g., 9796 for Afghanistan, 1991 for Albania).
- **New Cases**: New confirmed cases (e.g., 106 for Afghanistan, 117 for Albania).
- **New Deaths**: New deaths (e.g., 10 for Afghanistan, 6 for Albania).
- **New Recovered**: New recoveries (e.g., 18 for Afghanistan, 63 for Albania).
- **Deaths / 100 Cases**: Death rate per 100 cases (e.g., 3.5 for Afghanistan, 2.95 for Albania).
- **Recovered / 100 Cases**: Recovery rate per 100 cases (e.g., 69.49 for Afghanistan, 56.25 for Albania).
- **Deaths / 100 Recovered**: Death rate per 100 recovered cases (e.g., 5.04 for Afghanistan, 5.25 for Albania).
- **Confirmed (1 Week Change)**: Confirmed cases over the past week (e.g., 35526 for Afghanistan, 4171 for Albania).
- **Deaths (1 Week Change)**: Deaths over the past week (e.g., 737 for Afghanistan, 709 for Albania).
- **1 Week % Increase**: Percentage increase in cases over the past week (e.g., 2.07 for Afghanistan, 1.7 for Albania).
- **WHO Region**: Region as classified by WHO (e.g., Eastern Mediterranean for Afghanistan, Europe for Albania).

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
- **Dynamic and Interactive Visuals**: Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for intuitive data exploration.
- **Slicers and Filters**: Enable customized data views based on user selections.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Track critical metrics like case growth, recovery rates, and mortality.
- **Drill-Down Functionality**: Allows detailed analysis of specific data points (e.g., by country or region).
